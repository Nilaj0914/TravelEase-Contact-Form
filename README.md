# Terraform-portfolio-website

Built a Learner-level project where I hosted a static website using S3 static website hosting and made it publicly available using CloudFront. Used Terraform to provision the required infrastructure, hosted the Vercel Next.js boilerplate as the webpage, and distributed the website using CloudFront Content Delivery Network to make it publicly accessible using a single link. In the future, this website will be updated and will be used as my personal portfolio website
